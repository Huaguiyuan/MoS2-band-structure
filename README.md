<img src="http://rehnd.github.io/tutorials/vasp/pics/matproj-mos2.png" width="150px" align="right" hspace="20"/>
This repo provides files for electron band structure calculations and phonon calculations of bulk 2H-phase MoS2 for both Quantum Espresso and VASP.

Detailed tutorials for using both VASP and Quantum Espresso to compute electronic band structure and phonons can be found [here](https://rehnd.github.io/tutorials/dft).
